# hapi-fan-club

Just an example of using HAPI with [Glue](https://www.npmjs.com/package/glue) and [Confidence](https://www.npmjs.com/package/confidence). Mostly based on a [yo](http://yeoman.io/) template called [Hapi Style](https://github.com/jedireza/generator-hapi-style).

Now upgraded to use the latest version of everything Hapi.


## Usage

```bash
$ npm test
